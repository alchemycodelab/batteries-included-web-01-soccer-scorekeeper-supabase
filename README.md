# Supabase Soccer Scorekeeper

[Buggy Supabase Soccer Scorekeeper](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/buggy-js-soccer-scorekeeper-supabase)

## Learning Objectives
- Create an object containing complex values (objects or arrays) and access any item in that complex object using dot and bracket notation
- Display errors to users with an alert inside a .catch block
- In response to a user event, make a fetch call add a new object to the database and display the new state to the user.
